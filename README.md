# AFrame-orbit-control-to-look-control
Merging the two camera looking styles.

First, the orbit-control camera, which has its visual angle orbiting around the plane like a satellite.
Second, the look-control camera, which has a first person viewing angle and could walk along the plane and turn its head vertically and horizontally.

Using the "Switch" button to switch between two modes.
Get the first person camera position and looking direction by drawing a line on the up-right corner.
( The start point of the line would be the starting camera position in the first person viewing mode.
The End point of the line would be the point which the viewer will be looking in the first person viewing mode. )

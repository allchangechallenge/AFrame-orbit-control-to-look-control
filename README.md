# AFrame-orbit-control-to-look-control
Merging the two camera looking styles.

First, the orbit-control camera, which has its visual angle orbiting around the plane like a satellite. <br>
Second, the look-control camera, which has a first person viewing angle and could walk along the plane and turn its head vertically and horizontally. <br>

Using the "Switch" button to switch between two modes. <br>
Get the first person camera position and looking direction by drawing a line on the up-right corner. <br>
( The start point of the line would be the starting camera position in the first person viewing mode. <br>
The End point of the line would be the point which the viewer will be looking in the first person viewing mode. )
